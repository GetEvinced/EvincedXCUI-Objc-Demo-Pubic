This is an example repository for Swift to Objective-C interoperability that demonstrates on of the scenarios of how Evinced SDK could be used.

In this sample we took an Objective-C app, added [EvincedLauncher](TestUITests/EvincedLauncher.swift), that is fitted for a particular use case and enables Objective-C interoperability.
